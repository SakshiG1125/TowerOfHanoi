        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that was invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in
          1883. It is associated with a legend of a temple in Hanoi, Vietnam, where monks were given the task of moving
          64 golden disks from one peg to another, following specific rules.

        <h2>Mathematical Background</h2>
        <p>The Tower of Hanoi puzzle has deep connections to several mathematical concepts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recursive Problem Solving:</strong> The Tower of Hanoi is a classic example of a problem that can be
            solved using recursion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Binary Numbers:</strong> The states of the puzzle can be represented using binary numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exponential Complexity:</strong> The minimum number of moves required is 2<sup>n</sup> - 1.
          </li>
        </ul>
